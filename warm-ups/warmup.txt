     after looking at a few different positions in the software development career field i realize that
     i would still be want to be a full stack developer because it give me the chance to grow my overall
     skill in software development. im able to maintain my skill be a well-rounded developer and i also
     find it easier to know how something was code an for me to add on to it for better functionality.
